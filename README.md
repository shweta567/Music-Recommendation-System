# Music-Recommendation-System


Spotify's recommendation system, powered by machine 
learning, predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a
song within a set timeframe. Using a dataset with 1 indicating
repeated plays within a month, it tracks user song histories and
timestamps to generate personalized song recommendations.


 I have created Music Recommendation System using Spotify Dataset. To do this, I presented some of the visualization processes to understand data and done some EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) so we can select features that are relevant to create a Recommendation System.
